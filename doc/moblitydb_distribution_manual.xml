MobilityDB is an open source moving object database system. It is based on PostgreSQL and and built on top of PostGIS extension. It provides an effective functionality and new data type in order to store, analyze data trajectory.

As MobilityDB deal with a large dataset and it queries is very complex and expensive in term of cpu and memory comsuming. This behavior cannot be supported by a single host machine.

There is a way to make the MobilityDB queries more powerful and takes less execution time is to scaling up across a cluster of nodes. We have thinks on the On-premises cluster of machine but this is not enough according to the rapid grows of technologies and 5G network deployment sooner that will makes the MobilityDB dataset drastically big. In this respect the effective way to scale up the MobilityDB is to create our cluster on cloud services and using an orchestration as a control plane that manage the cluster. We have used another tool which is a Citus Data to gain more performance by partitioning tables on shards in single node. 

All the deployment manifests and configuration files, docker images and the requirements to deploy MobilityDB on AWS is located in this <ulink url="git@github.com:bouzouidja/scale_mobilitydb.git">Github repository</ulink>.
